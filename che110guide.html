            <h2>1. Understand the Impact of Fashion</h2>
            <p>The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world. It’s important to understand the impact of fast fashion on the environment:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Carbon Emissions:</strong> Fashion accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste:</strong> The average person buys 60% more clothing than they did 20 years ago, and clothes are worn half as long.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" id="buy-less">
            <h2>2. Buy Less, Choose Wisely</h2>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to reduce your impact is to buy fewer items, but make sure each one is high-quality, versatile, and timeless.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Over Quantity:</strong> Invest in durable clothing that will last longer.</li>
                <li><strong>Timeless Styles:</strong> Choose pieces that won't go out of fashion quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Impulse Purchases:</strong> Take your time to evaluate if you really need an item before purchasing it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" id="eco-fabrics">
            <h2>3. Prioritize Eco-Friendly Fabrics</h2>

            <h2>5. Embrace Secondhand Shopping</h2>
